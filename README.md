Greek abbreviations and acronyms
============================

Hi Designers and Developers (and Humans) interested in Web Accessibility!

I know that when you listen to the Greek language "it's all Greek to you".
By this project (repository), I want to deliver to the world a file (ideally an XML) with all Greek abbreviations and acronyms.
For each abbreviation or acronym, there will be:
* The abbreviation in Greek
* The abbreviation's explanation in Greek
* The abbreviation in English (optional)
* The abbreviation's explanation in English (optional)
* The most relevant link for each entity (optional)
* The produced HTML5 source, e.g.: 
```html
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
```
* Etc.
